# PREDICTIONS OF CO & NOx EMISSION FROM AUTOMOBILES TOWARDS A GREEN ENVIRONMENT in Nigeria,Africa

Over the past decades, atomopeheric pollution has raisen exponetially.
This Project addresses [SDG Goal 13](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal13)(Climate Action)

Also a large portion of POlution comes from Automobiles 
The Data was taken from [WorldBank Data Portal](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/home)

It visually expresses the increase of CO and NoX over time for 2 Decades(20 Years) in Nigeria   
Car exhaust contains gases such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen gasses and hydrocarbons that contribute to global climate change. Vehicle exhausts make a major contribution to air pollution and have important health effects.
The aim of our product is to create an easy way to predict the car emissions in Realtime, and interface with an IoT device that will maximize car performance while reducing exhaust emission.

## Data 
Data was experimental data to understand the operating conditions of a 4 stroke Spark Ignition(SI) engine at 1500 rpm

## WORKFLOW
1) Collect data
2) Clean Data and Visualize
3) Feature engineering 
4) Model(s) Developement and Evaluation
5) Choose best model
